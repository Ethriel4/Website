have to clean up the code later (scrapped a lot of ideas I tried to get to work) on a time crunch recenetly and just pushing some changes towards a direction that I can work off of as a base. 
Goal is to make it a somewhat suitable base webpage for a resume link and hyperlink to my blog (wherever I decided to host it)

Ideally i'll customize it more once I get back into learning JS and CSS it's been 2 years since I touched it so used a bit of help to make the pages xd
